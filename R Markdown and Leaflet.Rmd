## Introduction 

Leaflet is one of the most popular Javascript libraries for creating interactive maps. The leaflet R package allows you to create your own leaflet maps without needing to know any Javascript. 

## My Leaflet Map 

Getting started with leaflet is easy. The leaflet() function creates a map widget that you can store in a variable so that you can modify the map later on. You can add features to the map using the pipe operator (%>%) just like in dplyr. The addTiles() function adds mapping data from Open Street Map.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()
my_map
```

## Add Markers 

```{r}
my_map <- my_map %>%
  addMarkers(lat=12.079, lng=-12.2982,
             popup="Mali")
my_map
```
